As per the MovieLens IMDB dataset, 3 tables are considered: 
    1. movies
    2. ratings  
    3. tags. 
    
Movies table contains the Genre that is defined by movie makers. At the same time, tags table contains tag which is tagged by viewers. So my motivation is to find whether the movie makers genre is matching with viewers thought or viewers feel it some other genres. For example, when viewers tagged it as Sci-Fi movie in tags table, makers genre also includes as sci-fi in movies table.
